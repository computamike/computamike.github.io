## History

When I first started the Titanium Bunker blog back in 2010, I opted for the quickest and cheapest hosting system I could muster - shared hosting, and found that JustHost offered a reasonably priced solution - so I decided to use that - after all blogging was not something that I was doing all the time.

But attiudes to hosting your blog (and the services associated with it) have evolved over time, and I now felt that managing the simple wordpress architecture was something that I could - and indeed should - take more responsibility over.

I'd become aware of Digital Ocean through their hackotberfest event, and through colleagues at $DAY_JOB$
